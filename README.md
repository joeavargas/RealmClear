# RealmClear ✅
Clone of the Clear app using Realm persistent storage


## ⎔ SDK / Libraries / Frameworks ⎔
- UIKit
- Realm
- SwipeCellKit

## 📝 Features 
- Create a category and add items for each category.
- Tap each item to indicate that the item is done with a checkmark.
- Search for items to quickly query the one you're looking for sorted by date and time added.

- Note: this is the Realm version of the app. I'm currently working on a duplicate app that uses CoreData(link coming soon).
